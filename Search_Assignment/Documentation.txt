/**
    The Design Pattern used here is Filter Design Pattern.


    Definition: Filter pattern or Criteria pattern is a design pattern that
    enables developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria
    and chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations.

    Since, we need to filter the text files using some specified criteria ie., keyword
    Hence, used this design pattern.

/**

Dependency Tool used is Maven.

Maven is chiefly used for Java-based projects, helping to download dependencies,
which refers to the libraries or JAR files. The tool helps get the right JAR files
for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages.

It is used for getting JUnit dependency which is used for testing.
